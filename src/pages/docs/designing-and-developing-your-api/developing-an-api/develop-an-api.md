Use the Postman API Builder to develop your API's definition and build out your API with tests, documentation, and server-side code. Create or import common API definition types, including OpenAPI, GraphQL, Protobuf, RAML, and WSDL. Postman automatically validates requests and checks for errors as you work on your API.

* [Validate your API](#validate-your-api)

## Edit your API definition

Your API definition is the blueprint for your API's structure. To get started, create a new API definition or import an existing definition into the API Builder. Then use Postman's built-in tools to edit your API and preview API documentation as you work. Postman supports API definitions with multiple files, so you can add new files to a definition or import them from a connected Git repository.

## Add collections to your API

Postman Collections enable you to add API documentation and write API tests that you can automate. You can add a new collection or copy an existing collection to an API. You can also generate a collection from your API definition. Postman alerts you when there are differences between the generated collection and your definition, so you can always keep them in sync.
