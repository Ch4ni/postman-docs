## Manage your account, payment methods, and plan

To get started, you can learn how to [purchase and configure a paid Postman plan](/docs/billing/buying/).

You can use the Postman billing dashboard to [view and manage your team's billing](/docs/billing/billing/#billing-dashboard). This includes an overview of your Postman plan, past invoices, and billing-related activity. You can [manage your team's payment methods](/docs/billing/billing/#payments). You can also [make changes to your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes), including adjusting your team size, purchasing add-ons, and upgrading your plan.

## Track your resource usage

Depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you have a specified number of resources you can use each month. You can use the Resource Usage dashboard to [view the resources your team is using](/docs/billing/resource-usage/) and view your team's remaining limits for the month.
