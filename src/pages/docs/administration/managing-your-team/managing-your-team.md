Postman provides a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your team. As a [Team Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can streamline the onboarding process, manage access to workspaces and products, and customize your team's experience to align with your organization's goals.

> If you've just created your Postman team, check out Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/) to get started.

## Contents

* [Manage team members](#manage-team-members)
* [Manage team workspaces](#manage-team-workspaces)
* [Manage product access](#manage-product-access)
* [Manage team settings](#manage-team-settings)
* [Secure your Postman team](#secure-your-postman-team)

## Manage team members

You can [invite collaborators](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#inviting-users) to your Postman team, including Developers, Admins, external partners, and Guests. You can [update users' assigned roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#managing-team-roles) and manage their access to resources as needed.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can utilize [Postman groups](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/) to assign roles and manage access to elements at scale. 

## Manage team workspaces

[Team workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/) enable you to share projects with collaborators and manage access to them within your team. 

If you're setting up a [Professional or Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can also create [private workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/). A private workspace is a team workspace that is only visible to the user who created it and team members who have been invited to join it.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can also [manage which users can create team workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/). 

## Manage product access

You can [manage access](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/) to add-on products and Enterprise solutions that you've purchased for your team. This enables you to provide additional permissions and features to team members as needed.

## Manage team settings

/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/

## Secure your Postman team

* [Postman API key management](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/)
* [Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/)

<!--

Make sure to offer immediate value to readers in the overview. This could be in the form of a solution to a common problem, a brief explanation of a concept, or a preview of what readers can expect from the rest of the documentation.

Write a clear and concise overview that provides a succinct introduction to the topic. Use simple language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon, especially in the beginning.

Integrate long-tail keywords into your overview naturally. These specific phrases can help your content rank higher in searches for more niche topics. A relevant long-tail keyword for a Postman feature could be "Postman API testing tutorial for beginners" or "How to automate API testing with Postman." These keywords target users who are specifically interested in learning about API testing using Postman and indicate that the content will be focused on providing guidance, tutorials, or tips for beginners in this context.

Incorporate relevant internal and external links.

Use formatting techniques such as headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs in a way that enables easier scanning. -->
