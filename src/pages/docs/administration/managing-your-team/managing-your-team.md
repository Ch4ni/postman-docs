Postman provides a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your team. As a [Team Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can streamline the onboarding process, manage access to workspaces and products, and customize your team's experience to align with your organization's goals.

<!--

Make sure to offer immediate value to readers in the overview. This could be in the form of a solution to a common problem, a brief explanation of a concept, or a preview of what readers can expect from the rest of the documentation.

Write a clear and concise overview that provides a succinct introduction to the topic. Use simple language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon, especially in the beginning.

Integrate long-tail keywords into your overview naturally. These specific phrases can help your content rank higher in searches for more niche topics. A relevant long-tail keyword for a Postman feature could be "Postman API testing tutorial for beginners" or "How to automate API testing with Postman." These keywords target users who are specifically interested in learning about API testing using Postman and indicate that the content will be focused on providing guidance, tutorials, or tips for beginners in this context.

Incorporate relevant internal and external links.

Use formatting techniques such as headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs in a way that enables easier scanning. -->

## Managing your team’s Postman plan

You can manage your team size or upgrade your plan at any time during your team's billing cycle.

For more information, see [Team and plan changes](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

### Changing team size

If you want to change your team's size, you have two different options:

* **Change the number of paid seats** - Team members with the Billing role can change your team's number of paid seats in the [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview).
* **Turn on Auto-Flex** - Your team can invite more users without having to pay in advance for more seats with [Auto-Flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex).

For more information, see [Team and plan changes](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

### Upgrading your plan

Team members with the Billing role can upgrade your team plan in the [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview). For more information, see [Changing your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan).

## Updating your team’s Postman version

If your team isn't on the latest version of the desktop app, you can update your team to ensure everyone has access to the complete Postman API development experience.
