Postman has a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your Postman team. Whether you're setting up a new team or managing an existing one, you can customize your team's experience to align with your organization's policies.

As a [Team Admin or Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can use the following features to set up, manage, and secure your Postman team.

If you're settings up a new Postman team, check out Postman's [Onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/) to walk you through setting up your team for success.

## Set up and manage your Postman team

You can add and remove team members, Partners, and Guests in your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members). You can also update roles, adjust your team plan, or update your team settings as needed. To learn more, see [Manage your team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/).

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can learn more about all of the extra features available to you with [Postman Enterprise plans](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/). Enterprise features include advanced identity management, reports, a Private API Network, API governance and security controls, and features that enhance collaboration and administrative customization.

## Secure your Postman team

You can secure your Postman team's users by setting up [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/), [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), and [domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/). You can also [manage your team's API keys](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/), use the [Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/) to detect exposed secrets, and access your team's [audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/) as needed.
