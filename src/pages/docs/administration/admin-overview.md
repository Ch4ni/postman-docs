Postman has a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your Postman team. Whether you're setting up a new team or managing an existing one, you can customize your team's experience to align with your organization's goals.

You must be a [Team Admin or Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to set up, manage, and secure your Postman team.

If you're setting up a new Postman team, you can check out Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/) to walk you through setting up your team.

## Set up and manage your Postman team

You can [invite and manage collaborators](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-members) in your Postman team, which includes updating roles assigned to collaborators. You can also [adjust your team's Postman plan](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-your-teams-postman-plan) as needed.

You can [configure your team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) to further customize the experience for both your Postman team and your API's consumers. This includes team discoverability, your team's public profile, and authentication methods.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can learn more about the extra features available to you with [Postman Enterprise plans](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/). Enterprise features include advanced identity management, reports, a Private API Network, API governance and security controls, and features that enhance collaboration and administrative customization.

## Secure your Postman team

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can secure your Postman team's users by setting up [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/), [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), and [domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/). You can also [manage your team's API keys](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/), [use the Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/) to detect exposed secrets, and [access your team's audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/).
